title: Thinking like a programmer
---

I teach python.

There's a lot of gate-keeping in technical fields like software development. Often, people talk themselves out of learning new technical skills because they feel like it is somehow beyond them. They worry they lack a fundamental aptitude. This has always been wrong, but it has never been more wrong than now, in the age of AI assisted learning.

ChatGPT seems to know a lot about programming and especially python. This is no surprise. Python is the most popular programming language across many domains. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it an excellent choice for many different use cases. LLMs are trained on aggregated internet data, so it makes sense that python questions and answers are a particularly well covered area of knowledge.
