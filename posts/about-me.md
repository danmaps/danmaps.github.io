## Hi, I'm Danny.

![Danny McVey](..\static/images/danny.jpg)

With over a decade of experience under my belt, I've honed my skills as a GIS Technical Specialist, focusing on the design, implementation, and administration of large-scale GIS solutions. My roots run deep in geospatial analysis, data management, and workflow automation. I excel at harnessing the power of ArcGIS, crafting Python scripts, and merging GIS capabilities with other enterprise systems to make data more accessible and operations more streamlined.

### Professional Experience

I am currently employed at Southern California Edison, where I contribute my technical expertise to my team. My primary responsibility is to ensure the smooth execution of complex GIS projects. This involves leveraging my in-depth knowledge of Esri products and services to effectively manage GIS data operations.

### Key Skills

- **Enterprise GIS Solutions Design and Implementation**
- **Advanced ArcGIS Platform Configuration (Desktop, Server, Online)**
- **Programming/Scripting/Automation (Python, JavaScript)**
- **Driving Generative AI Tool Adoption**

### Passion and Goals

I'm fueled by my enthusiasm for GIS technology and tackling complex problems. Working alongside diverse teams to bring meaningful projects to life, making a real impact on communities, is what gets me going. Looking ahead, I'm excited to evolve from a GIS technician to a developer, crafting cutting-edge tools and solutions that harness the potential of geospatial data and generative AI.

### Personal Interests

When I'm not working, you can find me pounding the pavement or pushing weights at CrossFit. These activities help me stay energized and focused. I'm also passionate about tinkering with AI tools and finding innovative ways to apply them to my work.

Take a look at my portfolio to get a better sense of my projects and background. I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannymcvey/) and explore how we can work together to shape the future of GIS and data technology.
