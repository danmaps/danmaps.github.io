### The burden of actually caring

As I work on my personal projects, I often find myself stuck on the identifying problems to solve. I might have an idea of something that annoys me a try to launch an effort toward fixing it. "Rage programming". But I keep questioning the value of working on it.

The frequency of these ideas is high. I leave a lot of projects unfinished. Even, the ones I come back to repeatedly could be a waste of time and effort. I enjoy learning and experimenting, but I'm struggling to see the value of "puttering" like this in the long term.

Maybe this is what I want from a job. I want to be able to solve problems that are important to me, but also (crucially) to others too. At work I'll sink hours into automating a task for someone else. I'm trying to save them time. I barely understand their problems, but I dive in with enthusiasm and get a true feeling of satisfaction from successfully automating something they don't like to do.

I see professional work as a filter for my effort. It focuses the laser. I spend a bunch of time getting paid to do something, so I care a lot whether I generally enjoy it or not, but getting in community with a team where I feel valued for my contribution is __so much__ better than puttering on some half-baked experiment that I'm not sure will ever be useful, even to me.

I learn either way, but at work, prioritizing __real__ utility comes with the territory.

### The grass is always greener.

Sometimes I fantisize about a different job where I spend more (or all) of my time coding. Currently I'm spending most of my time (about 75%) communicating, writing, performing analysis, and making maps. 

This might shift my work life balance too much. 

### Leveraging AI to bring personal projects to completion

I'm going to create a structured process to solve this problem and relieve this frustration. See "Purpose-Driven Process"
