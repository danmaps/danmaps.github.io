title: Empowering Geospatial Workflows with Generative AI

---

This is a short blog post based on an hour long presentation/workshop I hosted recently.

Generative AI is transforming industries, and GIS professionals are uniquely positioned to leverage this technology to enhance workflows, increase productivity, and open up new possibilities in spatial analysis. In this blog post, we'll explore the role of generative AI in the GIS field, share best practices for effective prompting, and showcase some practical applications relevant to geospatial professionals.

### Introduction to Generative AI for GIS

Generative AI can be thought of as a highly creative assistant that can write, create images, code, and even assist in analysis. Unlike traditional AI systems that simply follow pre-programmed instructions, generative AI tools can learn from large datasets, adapt, and generate new outputs based on patterns it has identified. Examples include tools like GPT-4 for language tasks and DALL-E for image generation.

For GIS professionals, the power of generative AI lies in its ability to help with writing, automating repetitive tasks, and optimizing workflows. Whether it's drafting reports, coding in Python, or analyzing spatial data, AI can assist in all these areas.

### The Importance of Effective Prompting

To get the most out of generative AI, understanding how to structure your prompts is key. Here are some best practices:

- **Be Clear and Specific**: Instead of asking a vague question like "How do I use GIS for analysis?" try something more specific, such as "How do I perform proximity analysis in ArcGIS Pro to find parcels near schools?"
  
- **Provide Examples**: If you need the AI to generate a certain type of output, provide a clear example to guide it. For instance, "Draft a formal email summarizing a GIS project with the following structure..."
  
- **Step-by-Step Thinking**: For complex tasks, break them down. Rather than asking one large question, ask in steps, such as "First, how do I buffer points in ArcGIS Pro? Then, how do I select the parcels within 500 feet of a point?"
  
- **Iterative Refinement**: After receiving an initial response from the AI, you can fine-tune the output by refining your prompt. It’s an ongoing dialogue.

Prompting AI is different from performing a Google search. Google is about finding information, while AI helps generate content or solve problems through interaction.

### Generative AI Tools for GIS Professionals

There are several AI tools that can be integrated into GIS workflows. Here are some that are making an impact:

- **Microsoft Copilot**: A tool built into Microsoft 365 that can assist in automating tasks in Excel, Word, and other Office applications. For GIS professionals, this can help in spreadsheet analysis, report generation, and workflow automation.
  
- **ChatGPT**: A language model that excels at writing, coding assistance, and answering complex questions. For example, you could ask ChatGPT to help draft a technical report or optimize a Python script for GIS analysis.
  
- **GitHub Copilot**: An AI-powered code completion tool that can assist in coding tasks, such as writing Python scripts for spatial analysis or automating geoprocessing tasks in ArcGIS.

### Practical Applications of Generative AI in GIS

Generative AI has practical applications that can streamline many of the tasks GIS professionals deal with daily. Here are a few examples:

#### 1. **Writing: Drafting Reports**
Prompt: *Help me draft a summary of my GIS analysis findings on parcel proximity to schools.*
The AI can generate a well-structured report, saving hours of manual writing.

#### 2. **Excel Automation: Data Splitting**
Prompt: *I have a field in my Excel spreadsheet containing coordinates in the format ‘-117.69408694 32.77575342’. How can I split these into separate latitude and longitude columns?*
AI can either provide a formula or even split the data for you, depending on the tool you use.

#### 3. **GIS Workflow Optimization: Proximity Analysis**
Prompt: *I have an ArcGIS Pro project containing data layers for parcels, roads, and grocery stores. Describe how I can analyze which parcels are within 500 feet of a grocery store and fall inside certain residential zoning codes.*
The AI can guide you step-by-step, improving the efficiency of your analysis.

### Key Takeaways for GIS Professionals

1. **Iterative Mindset**: When working with AI, think of it as an ongoing conversation. Prompting requires context and refinement over time, not a one-shot approach like traditional searches.

2. **Stay Curious**: Generative AI is evolving rapidly. Stay up-to-date with new tools and techniques to ensure you’re leveraging the latest capabilities to enhance your geospatial work.

3. **Experiment and Share**: GIS professionals should experiment with AI tools and share their findings with colleagues. This culture of experimentation and knowledge-sharing helps improve AI adoption and innovation in the industry.

### Conclusion

Generative AI offers incredible potential for GIS professionals to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and automate routine tasks. By mastering the art of prompting and experimenting with the right tools, GIS professionals can unlock new efficiencies and innovations in spatial analysis. Stay curious, continue learning, and embrace the possibilities AI brings to the world of geomatics!
