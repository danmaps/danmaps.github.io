# GridScaper Contexts and Equipment Models

## Residential

**Vibe:** Quiet, homey, suburban or small-town feel

### Features:
- Single-family homes, driveways, and yards
- Wooden distribution poles with transformers
- Underground cables in newer areas
- School zones, parks, mailboxes
- Occasional people walking dogs or kids biking
- Lower voltage lines, service drops to homes

---

## Commercial

**Vibe:** Business-focused, practical, mid-rise density

### Features:
- Strip malls, office buildings, parking lots
- Larger transformers, pad-mounted gear
- More underground wiring or vaults
- Loading docks, delivery trucks
- Signage and street lighting
- Busier streets, moderate traffic

---

## Urban

**Vibe:** Dense, vertical, high-traffic

### Features:
- High-rises, alleys, fire escapes
- Metal streetlight poles, conduit-heavy systems
- Subsurface vaults and manholes
- Transit systems nearby (light rail, subway grates)
- Heavy pedestrian and car traffic
- Rooftop solar or backup generators on buildings

---

## Rural

**Vibe:** Open, spread out, nature-integrated

### Features:
- Farmland, dirt roads, barns, silos
- Long spans between poles
- Minimal underground wiring
- Wildlife visible (deer, hawks on poles)
- Fewer buildings, distant horizons
- Possible microgrids or standalone systems

---

## Environment

### Coastal

**Vibe:** Salty air, corrosion-aware design

#### Features:
- Ocean or bay in the distance
- Sandy soil, palm trees, coastal vegetation
- Shorter poles due to high wind loading
- Substations and gear with corrosion-resistant coatings
- Seabirds on wires, foghorns or waves in ambient audio
- Hurricane-prone considerations like guyed structures

### Mountain

**Vibe:** Rugged terrain, elevation variation

#### Features:
- Steep slopes, rocky terrain, pine forests
- Poles or towers placed with extreme angles or long spans
- Avalanche protection or line tensioning equipment
- Snow effects or early morning mist
- Remote cabins or ski lift infrastructure
- Easement cuts through forests

### Desert

**Vibe:** Arid, sun-blasted, wide open

#### Features:
- Sparse vegetation, sandy or rocky terrain
- Tall poles for long spans, thermal considerations
- Solar farms and battery storage possible
- Mirage or heat shimmer visual effects
- Minimal structures, fences, or signage
- Coyotes, vultures, and dry wind sounds

### City

**Vibe:** Dense infrastructure, vertical layering

#### Features:
- Gridlocked streets, skyscrapers, mass transit
- Electric vehicle chargers, underground vaults
- Streetlights and traffic signals on shared poles
- Complex conduit routing and switching equipment
- Constant movement: people, buses, delivery vehicles
- Drone delivery, smart city sensors possible

## Equipment

### Distribution

**Voltage:** ~4kV–35kV

#### Features:
- Wood or concrete poles
- Transformers, reclosers, capacitor banks
- Shorter span lengths, more frequent poles
- Service drops to buildings
- Lineworkers in bucket trucks
- Fuse cutouts and risers

### Sub Transmission

**Voltage:** ~33kV–138kV

#### Features:
- Steel poles or compact towers
- Larger conductor bundles
- Visible insulators and line hardware
- Substations with visible bus work
- Connects major substations to local distribution
- Rights-of-way cut through mixed settings

### Bulk Transmission

**Voltage:** 230kV+

#### Features:
- Lattice towers or tall monopoles
- Huge ROWs, 100+ ft tower spacing
- Long distances, fewer angles
- High tension lines with noticeable sag
- Audible line hum (corona discharge)
- Warning signs: “High Voltage,” no trespassing

### Generation

**Types:** Solar, wind, gas, hydro, nuclear

#### Features:
- Ground-mounted solar arrays with inverters
- Wind turbines with rotating blades
- Natural gas peaker plants or steam stacks
- Dams with hydro infrastructure
- Access roads, fenced perimeters, control rooms
- Connection points for intertie to grid
